# 🚀 GunaTeja • AI Vision Engineer

> *Building intelligent systems that see, understand, and decide.*

## 👋 Hey there!

I'm an AI Engineer crafting computer vision solutions that actually work in production. Less theory, more deployed models making real impact.

**📍 Based in Bengaluru, India** • **🎯 Specializing in CV + Deep Learning + Edge AI**

## ⚡ What I Work With
```python
stack = {
    "languages": ["Python", "Java", "C"],
    "ml_frameworks": ["PyTorch", "TensorFlow", "Scikit-Learn"],
    "vision": ["OpenCV", "YOLOv8", "PaddleOCR", "U-Net"],
    "current_obsession": ["Vision Transformers", "NeRF", "Edge Optimization"]
}
```

## 🎯 Projects That Shipped

**🔍 Real-Time Detection Engine**  
YOLOv8-powered system running at 60+ FPS on edge devices with 95%+ mAP. Handles 1000+ concurrent API requests like a champ.

**📄 Document Intelligence Pipeline**  
Multi-language OCR + layout analysis processing 500+ documents/hour at 98% accuracy. Production-ready NER and table extraction included.

**🏥 Medical Image Segmentation**  
U-Net architecture for 3D CT/MRI analysis with 94% Dice score. Clinical validation passed, DICOM integration smooth.

**👤 Face Recognition System**  
ArcFace-based platform recognizing 100K+ faces in <100ms with 99.8% accuracy. Privacy-preserving with liveness detection.

## 📊 By The Numbers
```
50+ models in production  |  5x speed optimizations  |  95%+ detection accuracy
98%+ OCR precision       |  1000+ images/sec        |  99.8% recognition rate
```

## 🧠 Currently Exploring
